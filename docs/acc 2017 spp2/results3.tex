\subsection{Robust Trajectory Tracking}
Fig. \ref{fig:rtt_traj} shows the vehicle trajectories in the situation where each vehicle robustly tracks a pre-specified trajectory and is guaranteed to stay inside a ``bubble" around the trajectory. Fig. \ref{fig:rtt_rs3} shows the evolution of BRS and induced obstacles for vehicle $\veh_3$. The obstacles induced by other vehicles inhibit the evolution of the BRS, carving out thin “channels,” which can be seen at $t = -2.59$, that separate the BRS into different “islands”. \MCnote{(deleted sentence)}%One can see how these channels and islands form by examining the time evolution of the BRS set.

$\ldt_i$ values for the four vehicles in this case are $-1.61, -3.16, -3.57$ and $-2.47$ respectively. In this method, vehicles use reduced control authority for path planning towards a reduced-size effective target set. As a result, higher-priority vehicles tend to have lower $\ldt$ compared to the other two methods, as evident from $\ldt_1$. Because of this ``sacrifice" made by the higher-priority vehicles during the path planning phase, the $\ldt$'s of lower-priority vehicles may increase compared to those in the other methods, as evident from $\ldt_4$. Overall, it is unclear how $\ldt_i$ will change for a vehicle compared to the other methods, as the conservative path planning increases $\ldt_i$ for higher-priority vehicles and decreases $\ldt_i$ for lower-priority vehicles.

Note that a smaller target set is used to compute the BRS to ensure that the vehicle reaches the target set by $t=0$ for any allowed tracking error.}
