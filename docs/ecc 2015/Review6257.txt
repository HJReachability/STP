======================

This paper deals with the problem of sequential safe path
planning for a group of N vehicles. Based on [21], a
tractable solution is provided solving a double-obstacle
Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs variational inequality. Through two
numerical examples, it is shown how the reach-avoid set is
computed for each vehicle and how the latest start time is
obtained. Compared to the exponential complexity of
single-obstacle HJI VI, this scheme provides linear
complexity with respect to the number of vehicles. 
This paper is interesting and well-written. The
contribution is clear since it provides an interesting
scalable solution to the path planning problem for
multi-agent systems. The SPP enables to reduce the
complexity of the problem. However, it will adds
conservatism since the problem will not be solved in a
fully decentralized way but in a leader-folllower way.
Furthermore, it induces a full knowledge of the agent
trajectories for lowest priority vehicles (problem of
security, delay in the computation if online planning,
etc.).
Other remarks are as follows:
- Page 2, \forall t \geq 0 should be replaced by \forall t
\geq t_i^{LST}
- Page 3, description of single-obstacle HJI VI is not
clear and not sufficiently detailed. For instance, Eq. (2)
is not understandable since V is not defined.
- Page 4, it is said that “an optimal control problem
involving only one vehicle and no adversary”. From my point
of view, this claim is not clear. Indeed, A_i(t) depends on
x_j.
- Algorithm 1 is hard to follow because of index k and
\bold{k}
- Fig. 4, where are results of single-obstacle (resp.
double-obtacle) HJI VI? Titles are not understandable.
- Very nice results are depicted in Fig. 6-8. These figures
well show the efficiency of the proposed scheme.
