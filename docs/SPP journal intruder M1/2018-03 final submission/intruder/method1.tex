%Intuitively, the number of vehicles that are affected by an intruder depends on how close the vehicles are to each other. For example, if the vehicles are in a dense configuration, then multiple vehicles might get affected by the intruder simultaneously and hence re-planning is required at a larger scale. In this section, we propose a method that guarantee intruder avoidance while allowing vehicles to be in a dense configuration, but may require a full re-planning of the system after the intruder disappears.     
Suppose some vehicle $\veh_i$ starts avoiding the intruder $\veh_{\intr}$ at some time $t = \tsa$, and stops avoiding at $t = \tea$. When $t < \tsa$, $\veh_i$ must plan its trajectory taking into account the possibility that it may need to avoid an intruder $\veh_\intr$. Since $\veh_i$ may spend a duration of up to $\iat$ performing avoidance, its induced obstacles $\ioset_k^i(t), k>i$ need to be computed in a way that reflects this possibility. The induced obstacles computation is discussed in Section \ref{sec:intruder_iocomp}.

We must also ensure that while avoiding the intruder, $\veh_i$ does not collide with the total obstacle set $\obsset_i(t)$. This requires computing the augmented total obstacle $\tilde\obsset_i(t)$; the computation of $\tilde\obsset_i(t)$ and the controller that guarantees the avoidance of the augmented obstacles are discussed in Section \ref{sec:intruder_aocomp}.

In Section \ref{sec:intruder_avoid}, we describe how $\veh_i$ can guarantee collision avoidance with the intruder. A pairwise collision avoidance problem such as this has been solved in isolation in \cite{Mitchell05}. Finally, when $t > \tea$, $\veh_i$ has already successfully avoided the intruder, but depending on the state it happens to arrive at after avoiding the intruder, it may need to re-plan its trajectory to reach the target safely. The re-planning process is discussed in Section \ref{sec:re-plan_method1}.

\subsubsection{Induced Obstacle Computation} \label{sec:intruder_iocomp}
The goal of this section is to compute, for each lower-priority vehicle $\veh_i$, the time-varying obstacles induced by each higher-priority vehicle $\veh_j, j < i$, denoted by $\ioset_i^j(t)$. As before, the total obstacle set $\obsset_i(t)$ can then be obtained using \eqref{eq:obsseti}. To compute the obstacle that $\veh_i$ needs to avoid at time $t$, it is sufficient to consider the scenarios where $\tsa \in [t-\iat, t]$. This is because if $\tsa < t - \iat$, then the STP vehicles would already be in the re-planning phase at time $t$ and hence cannot be in conflict. 

Depending on the information known to a lower-priority vehicle $\veh_i$ about $\veh_j$'s control strategy, we can use one of the three methods described in Section \ref{sec:incomp} to compute the ``base" obstacles $\boset_j(t)$; these are the obstacles that would have been induced by $\veh_j$ in the absence of an intruder. The base obstacles are respectively given by \eqref{eqn:ccObs_help2}, \eqref{eqn:lrcObs3} and \eqref{eqn:rttObs} for the centralized control, least restrictive control and robust trajectory tracking methods.

The induced obstacles, $\ioset_i^j(t)$, are then given by the states that $\veh_j$ can reach while avoiding the intruder, starting from some state in $\boset_j(\tsa), \tsa \in [t-\iat, t]$. These states can be obtained by computing an FRS from the base obstacles.
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:FRS_intObs1}
\begin{aligned}
&\frs_{j}^{\mathcal{O}}(t-\tau, t) = \{y: \exists \ctrl_j(\cdot) \in \cfset_j, \exists \dstb_j(\cdot) \in \dfset_j, \state_j(\cdot) \\
&\quad \text{ satisfies \eqref{eq:dyn}}, \state_j(t-\tau) \in \boset_j(t-\tau), \state_j(t) = y\}.
\end{aligned}
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\end{equation}
$\frs_{j}^{\mathcal{O}}(t-\tau, t)$ represents the set of all possible states that $\veh_j$ can reach after a duration of $\tau$ starting from inside $\boset_j(t-\tau)$. This FRS can be obtained by solving the HJ VI in \eqref{eq:HJIVI_FRS} with the following Hamiltonian:
\vspace{-0.15cm}
\begin{equation}
\ham_{j}^{\mathcal{O}}(\state_j, \costate) = \max_{\ctrl_j \in \cset_j} \max_{\dstb_j \in \dset_j} \costate \cdot f_j (\state_j, \ctrl_j, \dstb_j) \label{intobs2}.
\end{equation} 
Since $\tau \in [0, \iat]$, the induced obstacles can be obtained as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:intObs}
\begin{aligned}
\ioset_i^j(t) & = \{\state_i: \exists y \in \pfrs_j(t), \|\pos_i - y\|_2 \le \rc \}\\
\pfrs_j(t) & = \{p_j: \exists \npos_j, (p_j, \npos_j) \in \bigcup_{\tau \in [0, \iat]} \frs_{j}^{\mathcal{O}}(t-\tau, t) \}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Note that by the definition of base obstacles, $\boset_j(t+\tau_2) \subseteq \frs_{j}^{\text{BO}}(t+\tau_1, t+\tau_2) ~\forall t, \tau_2 > \tau_1$, where $\frs_{j}^{\text{BO}}(t+\tau_1, t+\tau_2)$ denotes the FRS of $\boset_j(t+\tau_1)$ computed for a duration of $\tau_2-\tau_1$. Therefore, we have that $\frs_{j}^{\mathcal{O}}(t-\tau, t) \subseteq \frs_{j}^{\mathcal{O}}(t-\iat, \iat) ~\forall \tau \in [0, \iat]$. Thus, $\pfrs_j(t)$ in \eqref{eq:intObs} can be equivalently written as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:intObs_help1}
\pfrs_j(t) = \{p_j: \exists \npos_j, (p_j, \npos_j) \in \frs_{j}^{\mathcal{O}}(t-\iat, t) \}.
\end{equation}

%
%Since there are no moving vehicle obstacles for the highest priority vehicle, $\obsset_1(t) = \soset$. 
%
%Computation of these base obstacles would requires information of a corresponding ``base" BRS of $\veh_j$; the process for computing this set is outlined in Step 2. In this section, we assume that the sequence of base obstacles, $\boset_i^j(t)$, is known. Given $\boset_i^j(t)$, we now show how to compute the obstacle set $\obsset_i(t)$. The induced obstacles are given by the states a vehicle can reach while avoiding the intruder, on top of the base obstacles. 

\subsubsection{Augmented Obstacle Computation} \label{sec:intruder_aocomp}
We next need to ensure that $\veh_i$ does not collide with the obstacles $\obsset_i(\cdot)$ computed in Section \ref{sec:intruder_iocomp} even when it is avoiding the intruder. In particular, we can compute a region around the obstacles $\obsset_i(\cdot)$ such that for all disturbances, $\veh_i$ can avoid colliding with obstacles for $\iat$ seconds regardless of its avoidance control, if $\veh_i$ starts outside this region. Augmenting $\obsset_i(\cdot)$ with this region gives us the augmented obstacles, $\tilde\obsset_i(\cdot)$, that can then be used during the trajectory planning of $\veh_i$ to ensure collision avoidance with $\obsset_i(\cdot)$.  

Suppose that the intruder appears in the system at some time time $\tsa = t - \iat + \tau, \tau \in [0, \iat]$. In this case, we need to ensure that $\veh_i$ does not collide with the obstacle $\obsset_i(t + \tau)$ at time $t + \tau$, regardless of its control $\ctrl_i(s)$ and disturbance $\dstb_i(s)$ for the time interval $s \in [\tsa, t + \tau]$. It is, therefore, sufficient to avoid the $\tau$-horizon BRS of $\obsset_i(t + \tau)$ at time $t$. This argument applies for all $\tau \in [0, \iat]$. Mathematically,
\vspace{-0.15cm}
%\begin{equation} \label{eqn:inducedobs}
%\tilde\obsset_i(t) = \bigcup_{\tau \in [0, \iat]} \brs_{\mathcal{G}}(\tau, \obsset_i(t+\tau), \emptyset, \ham_{\mathcal{G}})
%\end{equation}
%where $\brs_{\mathcal{G}}(\tau, \obsset_i(t+\tau), \emptyset, \ham_{\mathcal{G}})$ represents BRS of $\obsset_i(t+\tau)$ computed backwards for $\tau$ seconds. The Hamiltonian 
%$\ham_{\mathcal{G}}$ is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:inducedobs}
\tilde\obsset_i(t) = \bigcup_{\tau \in [0, \iat]} \brs^{\mathcal{G}}_{i}(t, t+\tau)
\end{equation}
where $\brs^{\mathcal{G}}_{i}(t, t+\tau)$ represents BRS of $\obsset_i(t+\tau)$ computed backwards for $\tau$ seconds. Formally, 
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:inducedobs_help1}
\begin{aligned}
\brs^{\mathcal{G}}_{i}(t, t+\tau) = & \{y: \exists \ctrl_i(\cdot) \in \cfset_i, \exists \dstb_i(\cdot) \in \dfset_i, \\
& \state_i(\cdot) \text{ satisfies \eqref{eq:dyn}}, \state_i(t) = y, \\
& \exists s \in [t, t+\tau], \state_i(s) \in \obsset_i(s)\}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The Hamiltonian $\ham^{\mathcal{G}}_{i}$ to compute $\brs^{\mathcal{G}}_{i}(\cdot)$ is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:BRS_obsham}
\ham^{\mathcal{G}}_{i}(\state_i, \costate) = \min_{\ctrl_i \in \cset_i} \min_{\dstb_i \in \dset_i} \costate \cdot f_i (\state_i, \ctrl_i, \dstb_i)
\end{equation}

\begin{remark}
Note that if we use the robust trajectory tracking method to compute the base obstacles, we would need to augment the obstacles in \eqref{eqn:inducedobs} by the error bound of $\veh_i$, $\disckernel_i$, as discussed in section \ref{sec:rtt}.
\end{remark}

Finally, we compute a BRS $\brs^{\text{AO}}_{i}(t, \sta_i)$ for trajectory planning that contains the initial state of $\veh_i$ while avoiding these augmented obstacles:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:intrBRS1}
\begin{aligned}
\brs^{\text{AO}}_{i}(t, \sta_i) = & \{y: \exists \ctrl_i(\cdot) \in \cfset_i, \forall \dstb_i(\cdot) \in \dfset_i, \\
& \state_i(\cdot) \text{ satisfies \eqref{eq:dyn}}, \forall s \in [t, \sta_i], \state_i(s) \notin \tilde\obsset_i(s), \\
& \exists s \in [t, \sta_i], \state_i(s) \in \targetset_i, \state_i(t) = y \}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The Hamiltonian $\ham^{\text{AO}}_{i}$ to compute BRS in \eqref{eqn:intrBRS1} is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:BRSham}
\ham^{\text{AO}}_{i}(\state_i, \costate) = \min_{\ctrl_i \in \cset_i} \max_{\dstb_i \in \dset_i} \costate \cdot f_i (\state_i, \ctrl_i, \dstb_i)
\end{equation}

Note that $\brs^{\text{AO}}_{i}(\cdot)$ ensures goal satisfaction for $\veh_i$ in the absence of intruder. The goal satisfaction controller is given by
\begin{equation}
{\ctrl^{\text{AO}}_{i}}(t, \state_i) = \arg \min_{\ctrl_i \in \cset_i} \max_{\dstb_i \in \dset_i} \costate \cdot f_i (\state_i, \ctrl_i, \dstb_i)
\end{equation}
Moreover, if $\veh_i$ starts within $\brs^{\text{AO}}_{i}$, it is guaranteed to avoid collision for a duration of $\iat$, starting at any $\tsa < \sta_i$, irrespective of the control and disturbance applied during this time period. 

\subsubsection{Optimal Avoidance Controller} \label{sec:intruder_avoid}
First, we define relative dynamics of the intruder $\veh_{\intr}$ with state $\state_\intr$ with respect to $\veh_i$ with state $\state_i$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reldyn}
\begin{aligned}
\state_{\intr, i} &= \state_\intr - \state_i \\
\dot \state_{\intr, i} &= f_r(\state_{\intr, i}, \ctrl_i, \ctrl_\intr, \dstb_i, \dstb_\intr)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Given the relative dynamics, we compute the set of states from which the joint states of $\veh_{\intr}$ and $\veh_i$ can enter danger zone $\dz_{i\intr}$ despite the best efforts of $\veh_i$ to avoid $\veh_{\intr}$. This set of states is given by the BRS $\brs^{\text{CA}}(t, \iat),~ t \in [0, \iat]$:%(\iat, \targetset_\text{CA}, \obsset_\text{CA}, H_\text{CA})$, with

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:optAvoid}
\begin{aligned}
\brs^{\text{CA}}_{i}(t, \iat) = & \{y: \forall \ctrl_i(\cdot) \in \cfset_i, \exists \ctrl_\intr(\cdot) \in \cfset_\intr, \exists \dstb_i(\cdot) \in \dfset_i, \\
& \exists \dstb_\intr(\cdot) \in \dfset_\intr, \state_{\intr, i}(\cdot) \text{ satisfies \eqref{eq:reldyn}},\\
& \exists s \in [t, \iat], \state_{\intr, i}(s) \in \targetset^{\text{CA}}_{i}, \state_{\intr, i}(t) = y\},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\targetset^{\text{CA}}_{i} = \{\state_{\intr, i}: \|\pos_{\intr, i}\|_2 \le \rc\}$, and the Hamiltonian for computing this BRS is given by
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
&H^{\text{CA}}_{i}(\state_{\intr, i}, \costate) = \max_{\ctrl_i \in \cset_i} \Big( \\
&\qquad \qquad \qquad \min_{\ctrl_\intr \in \cset_\intr, \dstb_i \in \dset_i, \dstb_\intr \in \dset_\intr} \costate \cdot f_r(\state_{\intr, i}, \ctrl_i, \ctrl_\intr, \dstb_i, \dstb_\intr) \Big)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Once the value function $\valfunc^{\text{CA}}_{i}(t, \state_{\intr, i})$ corresponding to the BRS $\brs^{\text{CA}}_{i}(t, \iat)$ is computed, the optimal avoidance control ${\ctrl^{\text{CA}}_{i}}$ can be obtained as:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:optAvoidCtrl}
\begin{aligned}
&{\ctrl^{\text{CA}}_{i}}(t, \state_i, \state_\intr)  = \arg \max_{\ctrl_i \in \cset_i} \Big( \\
&\qquad \qquad \qquad \min_{\ctrl_\intr \in \cset_\intr, \dstb_i \in \dset_i, \dstb_\intr \in \dset_\intr} \costate \cdot f_r(\state_{\intr, i}, \ctrl_i, \ctrl_\intr, \dstb_i, \dstb_\intr) \Big)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Under normal circumstances when the intruder $\veh_{\intr}$ is far away, we have $\valfunc^{\text{CA}}_{i}(0, \state_{\intr, i}) > 0$; as $\veh_{\intr}$ gets closer to $\veh_i$, $\valfunc^{\text{CA}}_{i}(0, \state_{\intr, i})$ decreases. If $\veh_i$ applies the control ${\ctrl^{\text{CA}}_{i}}$ when $\valfunc^{\text{CA}}_{i}(0, \state_{\intr, i}) = 0$, then collision avoidance between $\veh_i$ and $\veh_{\intr}$ is guaranteed for a duration of $\iat$ under the worst-case intruder control strategy.

In addition, obstacle augmentation \eqref{eqn:inducedobs} ensures that $\veh_i$ does not collide with $\obsset_i(\cdot)$ during the avoidance maneuver. %Therefore, applying $\ctrl_I^A$ for a duration of $\iat$ is still guaranteed to keep $\veh_i$ safe from all obstacles, and hence safe from collision with respect to all other vehicles $\veh_j, j \neq i$.
The overall control policy for avoiding the intruder and collision with other vehicles is thus given by:
\begin{equation*}
{\ctrl^{\text{A}}_{i}}(t) = 
\left \{ 
\begin{array}{ll}
{\ctrl^{\text{AO}}_{i}}(t, \state_i) & t \leq \tsa\\
{\ctrl^{\text{CA}}_{i}}(t, \state_i, \state_\intr) & \tsa\leq t \leq \tea
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Replanning after intruder avoidance\label{sec:re-plan_method1}} 
After the intruder disappears, goal satisfaction controllers which ensure that the vehicles reach their destinations can be obtained by solving an STP problem as described in Section \ref{sec:incomp}, where the starting states of the vehicles are now given by the states they end up in, denoted $\tilde{\state}_j^0$, after avoiding the intruder. Let the optimal control policy corresponding to this goal satisfaction controller be denoted ${\ctrl^{\text{L}}_{i}}(t, \state_i)$. The overall control policy that ensures intruder avoidance, collision avoidance with other vehicles, and successful transition to the destination is given by
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{equation*}
\ctrl_i^*(t) = 
\left \{ 
\begin{array}{ll}
{\ctrl^{\text{A}}_{i}}(t, \state_i) & t \leq \tea\\
{\ctrl^{\text{L}}_{i}}(t, \state_i) & t > \tea
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}

Note that in order to re-plan using a STP method, we need to determine feasible $\sta_i$ for all vehicles. This can be done by computing an FRS:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:re-planFRS}
\begin{aligned} 
\frs_i^{\text{RP}}(\tea, t) = & \{y \in \R^{n_i}: \exists \ctrl_i(\cdot) \in \cfset_i, \forall \dstb_i(\cdot) \in \dfset_i, \\
& \state_i(\cdot) \text{ satisfies \eqref{eq:dyn}}, \state_i(\tea) = \tilde{\state}_i^0, \\
& \state_i(t) = y, \forall s \in [\tea, t], \state_i(s) \notin \obsset_i^{\text{RP}}(s) \},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\tilde{\state}_i^0$ represents the state of $\veh_i$ at $t = \tea$; $\obsset_i^{\text{RP}}(\cdot)$ takes into account the fact that $\veh_i$ needs to avoid higher-priority vehicles $\veh_j, j<i$ and is defined in an way analogous to \eqref{eq:obsseti}.
%\begin{equation} 
%\obsset_j^{\text{RP}}(t) = \bigcup_{k<j} \frs_k^{\text{RP}}(\tea, t), ~~~t > \tea.
%\end{equation}

The FRS in \eqref{eq:re-planFRS} can be obtained by solving %the HJ VI in \eqref{eq:HJIVI_FRS} with the following Hamiltonian:
\vspace{-0.15cm}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\max \Big\{&D_t \valfuncfwd^{\text{RP}}(t, \state_i) + \ham_i^{\text{RP}}(t, \state_i, \nabla \valfuncfwd^{\text{RP}}(t, \state_i)), \\
&\qquad - \obsfunc^{\text{RP}}(t, \state_i) - \valfuncfwd^{\text{RP}}(t, \state_i) \Big\} = 0\\
&\valfuncfwd^{\text{RP}}(\tsa, \state_i) = \max\{\fc^{\text{RP}}(\state_i), -\obsfunc^{\text{RP}}(\tsa, \state_i)\} \\
&\ham_i^{\text{RP}}(\state_i, \costate) = \max_{\ctrl_i \in \cset_i} \min_{\dstb_i \in \dset_i} \costate \cdot f_i (\state_i, \ctrl_i, \dstb_i)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 

\noindent where $\valfuncfwd^{\text{RP}}, \obsfunc^{\text{RP}}, \fc^{\text{RP}}$ represent the FRS, obstacles during re-planning, and the initial state of $\veh_i$, respectively. The new $\sta$ of $\veh_j$ is now given by the earliest time at which $\frs_j^{\text{RP}}(\tea, t)$ intersects the target set $\targetset_j$, $\sta_j := \arg \inf_t \{ \frs_j^{\text{RP}}(\tea, t) \cap \targetset_j \neq \emptyset \}$. Intuitively, this means that there exists a control policy which will steer the vehicle to its destination by that time, despite the worst case disturbance it might experience. Note that, in theory, $\tilde{\state}_j^0$ could be such that it is impossible to reach the target region starting from $\tilde{\state}_j^0$; however, for most practical systems target remains feasible given a long enough time horizon to reach the target.

\begin{remark}
Note that we only need to re-plan the trajectories of the vehicles that are affected by the intruder. In particular, if $\valfunc^{\text{CA}}(0, \state_{\intr, i}(t)) > 0$ during the entire duration $t \in [\tsa, \tea]$ for a vehicle, then the vehicle would need not to apply any avoidance control, and hence re-planning would not be required for this vehicle. 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
In general, an intruder can be present in the system for much longer than $\iat$, as long as it is not affecting the STP vehicles. $\tsa$ thus really corresponds to the time an intruder starts affecting a STP vehicle.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Note that even though we have presented the analysis for one intruder, the proposed method can handle multiple intruders as long as only one intruder is present \textit{at any given time}. 
\end{remark}

We conclude this section with the STP algorithm that takes into account an intruder that may appear for a duration of $\iat$: 
\begin{alg}
\label{alg:intruder}
\textbf{Intruder Avoidance algorithm (offline planning)}: Given initial conditions $\state_i^0$, vehicle dynamics \eqref{eq:dyn}, intruder dynamics in Assumption \ref{as:dynKnown}, target sets $\targetset_i$, and static obstacles $\soset_i, i = 1\ldots, \N$, for each $i$,
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin = 0.5cm]
\item determine the total obstacle set $\obsset_i(t)$, given in \eqref{eq:obsseti}. In the case $i=1$, $\obsset_i(t) = \soset_i ~ \forall t$;
\item compute the augmented obstacle set $\tilde\obsset_i(t)$ given by \eqref{eqn:inducedobs}, where $\brs^{\mathcal{G}}_{i}(0, \tau)$ is given by \eqref{eqn:inducedobs_help1};
\item given $\tilde\obsset_i(t)$, compute the BRS $\brs^{\text{AO}}_{i}(t, \sta_i)$ defined in \eqref{eqn:intrBRS1};
\item the optimal control to avoid the intruder can be obtained by computing $\brs^{\text{CA}}_{i}(t, \iat)$ in \eqref{eqn:optAvoid} and using \eqref{eqn:optAvoidCtrl};
\item the induced obstacles $\ioset_k^i(t)$ for each $k>i$ can be computed using \eqref{eq:intObs}.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Intruder Avoidance algorithm (online re-planning)}: For each vehicle $i$ that performed avoidance,
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin = 0.5cm]
\item compute $\frs_i^{\text{RP}}(\tea, t)$ using $\eqref{eq:re-planFRS}$. The new $\sta_i$ for $\veh_i$ is given by $\arg \inf_t \{ \frs_j^{\text{RP}}(\tea, t) \cap \targetset_j \neq \emptyset \}$;
\item given $\sta_i$, $\tilde{\state}_i^0$, vehicle dynamics \eqref{eq:dyn}, target set $\targetset_i$, and static obstacles $\soset_i, i = 1\ldots, \N$, use any of the three STP methods discussed in Section \ref{sec:incomp} for re-planning. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{alg}
