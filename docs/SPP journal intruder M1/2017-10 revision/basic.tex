\section{STP Without Disturbances and With Perfect Information\label{sec:basic}}
In this section, we introduce the basic STP algorithm assuming that there is no disturbance affecting the vehicles, and that each vehicle knows the exact position of higher-priority vehicles. \SBnote{Although in practice, such assumptions do not hold, the description of the basic STP algorithm will introduce the notation needed for describing the subsequent, more realistic versions of STP.} We also show simulation results for the basic STP algorithm. The majority of the content in this section is taken from \cite{Chen15c}.

\subsection{Theory}
Recall that the STP vehicles $\veh_i, i=1,\ldots,N$, are each assigned a strict priority, with $\veh_j$ having a higher priority than $\veh_i$ if $j<i$. In the absence of disturbances, we can write the dynamics of the STP vehicles as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dyn_no_dstb}
\begin{aligned}
\dot\state_i &= \fdyn_i(\state_i, \ctrl_i), t \le \sta_i \\
\ctrl_i &\in \cset_i, \qquad i = 1 \ldots, \N
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

%\noindent with trajectories denoted by $\traj_i(s; \state^0_i, \ldt, \ctrl_(\cdot))$.

In STP, each vehicle $\veh_i$ plans the trajectory to its target set $\targetset_i$ while avoiding static obstacles $\soset_i$ and the obstacles $\ioset_i^j(t)$ induced by higher-priority vehicles $\veh_j, j<i$. Path planning is done sequentially starting from the first vehicle and proceeding in descending priority, $\veh_1, \veh_2, \ldots, \veh_{\N}$ so that each of the trajectory planning problems can be done in the state space of only one vehicle. During its trajectory planning process, $\veh_i$ ignores the presence of lower-priority vehicles $\veh_k, k>i$, and induces the obstacles $\ioset_k^i(t)$ for $\veh_k, k>i$.

From the perspective of $\veh_i$, each of the higher-priority vehicles $\veh_j, j<i$ induces a time-varying obstacle denoted $\ioset_i^j(t)$ that $\veh_i$ needs to avoid\footnote{Note that the index $k$ in $\ioset_k^i$ denotes vehicles with lower priority than $\veh_i$, and the index $j$ in $\ioset_i^j(t)$ denotes vehicles with higher priority than $\veh_i$.}. Therefore, each vehicle $\veh_i$ must plan its trajectory to $\targetset_i$ while avoiding the union of all the induced obstacles as well as the static obstacles. Let $\obsset_i(t)$ be the union of all the obstacles that $\veh_i$ must avoid on its way to $\targetset_i$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:obsseti}
\obsset_i(t)  = \soset_i \cup \bigcup_{j=1}^{i-1} \ioset_i^j(t)
\end{equation}

With full position information of higher priority vehicles, the obstacle induced for $\veh_i$ by $\veh_j$ is simply

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ioset}
\ioset_i^j(t) = \{\state_i: \|\pos_i - \pos_j(t)\|_2 \le \rc \}
\end{equation}

Each higher priority vehicle $\veh_j$ plans its trajectory while ignoring $\veh_i$. Since trajectory planning is done sequentially in descending order or priority, the vehicles $\veh_j, j<i$ would have planned their trajectories before $\veh_i$ does. Thus, in the absence of disturbances, $\pos_j(t)$ is \textit{a priori} known, and therefore $\ioset_i^j(t), j<i$ are known, deterministic moving obstacles, which means that $\obsset_i(t)$ is also known and deterministic. Therefore, the trajectory planning problem for $\veh_i$ can be solved by first computing the BRS $\brs_i^\text{basic}(t, \sta_i)$, defined as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:BRS_basic}
\begin{aligned}
\brs_i^\text{basic}(t, \sta_i) = & \{y: \exists \ctrl_i(\cdot) \in \cfset_i, \state_i(\cdot) \text{ satisfies \eqref{eq:dyn_no_dstb}}, \\
& \forall s \in [t, \sta_i],\state_i(s) \notin \obsset_i(s), \\
& \exists s \in [t, \sta_i], \state_i(s) \in \targetset_i, \state_i(t) = y\}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
The BRS $\brs(t, \sta_i)$ can be obtained by solving \eqref{eq:HJIVI_BRS} with $\targetset = \targetset_i$, $\obsset(t) = \obsset_i(t)$, and the Hamiltonian 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:basicham}
\ham_i^\text{basic}(\state_i, \costate) = \min_{\ctrl_i\in\cset_i} \costate \cdot \fdyn_i(\state_i, \ctrl_i)
\end{equation}
%
\SBnote{Note that $\brs(t, \sta_i)$, by definition, does not contain any states from which it is inevitable to avoid the danger zone $\dz_{ij}$ (and $\obsset_i$ in general).} Given $\brs(t, \sta_i)$, the optimal control for reaching $\targetset_i$ while avoiding $\obsset_i(t)$ is then given by
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:basicOptCtrl}
\ctrl_i^\text{basic}(t, \state_i) = \arg \min_{\ctrl_i\in\cset_i} \costate \cdot \fdyn_i(\state_i, \ctrl_i)
\end{equation}
%
\noindent from which the trajectory $\state_i(\cdot)$ can be computed by integrating the system dynamics, which in this case are given by \eqref{eq:dyn_no_dstb}. In addition, the latest departure time $\ldt_i$ can be obtained from the BRS $\brs(t, \sta_i)$ as $\ldt_i = \arg \sup_t \{\state_i^0 \in \brs(t, \sta_i)\}$. In summary, the basic STP algorithm is given as follows:

\begin{alg}
\label{alg:basic}
\textbf{Basic STP algorithm}: Suppose we are given initial conditions $\state_i^0$, vehicle dynamics \eqref{eq:dyn_no_dstb}, target sets $\targetset_i$, and static obstacles $\soset_i, i = 1\ldots, \N$. For each $i$ in ascending order starting from $i=1$ (which corresponds to descending order of priority),
\begin{enumerate}
\item determine the total obstacle set $\obsset_i(t)$, given in \eqref{eq:obsseti}. In the case $i=1$, $\obsset_i(t) = \soset_i ~ \forall t$;
\item compute the BRS $\brs_i^\text{basic}(t, \sta_i)$ defined in \eqref{eq:BRS_basic}. The latest departure time $\ldt_i$ is then given by $\arg \sup_t \{\state^0_i \in \brs_i^\text{basic}(t, \sta_i)\}$;
\item determine the trajectory $\state_i(\cdot)$ using vehicle dynamics \eqref{eq:dyn_no_dstb}, with the optimal control  $\ctrl_i^\text{basic}(\cdot)$ given by \eqref{eq:basicOptCtrl};
\item given $\state_i(\cdot)$, compute the induced obstacles $\ioset_k^i(t)$ for each $k>i$. In the absence of disturbances, $\ioset_k^i(t)$ is given by \eqref{eq:ioset}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{alg}

\MCnote{Note that Step 1, which determines the total obstacle set, can be updated in a recursive manner by adding a new set of induced obstacles for each next vehicle: $\obsset_{i+1}(t) = \obsset_i(t) \cup \ioset_{i+1}^i(t)$. In addition, in implementation, Step 4 can be simplified by storing $\obsset_i(t)$ as a look-up table with the maximum dimensionality across all vehicle state spaces. When a vehicle plans its trajectory, irrelevant dimensions of $\obsset_i(t)$ can be ignored. This observation keeps the computational complexity of our algorithm linear with respect to the number of vehicles.}

\MCnote{As previously mentioned, the basic STP algorithm, as well as all subsequent variants of STP algorithms, will \textit{always} return a feasible trajectory that arrives at the target on time, as long as a feasible trajectory exists in the \textit{absence} of other vehicles. This is because a vehicle can simply depart early enough to avoid being blocked by higher-priority vehicles. In fact, the latest departure time $\ldt_i$ quantifies exactly when each vehicle needs to depart to arrive on time.}
