\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We have proposed three different methods of generating induced obstacles in the sequential path planning method. In each method, different assumptions about the control strategy of higher-priority are mad. In all of the methods, all vehicles are guaranteed to successfully arrive and their respective destinations without entering each other's danger zones despite the worst-case disturbance the vehicles could experience. Future work includes exploring methods for fast re-planning, and making the multi-vehicle system robust to unforeseen circumstances such as the presence of intruders.
