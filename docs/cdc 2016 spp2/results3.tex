\subsection{Robust Trajectory Tracking}
\SBnote{Change results based on new simulations.}
Fig. \ref{fig:rtt_traj} shows the vehicle trajectories in the situation where each vehicle tracks a pre-specified trajectory and is guaranteed to stay inside a ``bubble" around the trajectory. Fig. \ref{fig:rtt_rs3} shows the evolution of BRS and induced obstacles for vehicle $\veh_3$. The obstacles induced by other vehicles inhibit the evolution of the BRS, carving out thin “channels,” which can be seen at $t = -2.63$, that separate the BRS into different “islands”. One can see how these channels and islands form by examining the time evolution of the BRS set.

$\ldt_i$ numbers for the four vehicles in this case are $-1.63, -3.16, -3.61$ and $-2.49$ respectively. In this method, vehicles use reduced control authority for path planning towards a reduced-size effective target set. As a result, higher-priority vehicles tend to have higher $\ldt$ compared to the other two methods, as evident from $\ldt_1$. Because of this ``sacrifice" by the higher-priority vehicles in the path planning process, the $\ldt$ of lower priority vehicles may increase compared to that in the other methods, as evident from $\ldt_4$. Overall, it is unclear whether $\ldt_i$ for a vehicle would increase or decrease compared to the other methods, as $\ldt_i$ is increased by a conservative path planning by higher-priority vehicles, and decreased by a conservative path planning of $\veh_i$.

The obstacle at $t =-0.63$ and $t=-1.83$ are induced by $\veh_1$ and the obstacle at $t =-2.63$ is induced by $\veh_2$. Note that a smaller target set is used to compute the BRS to ensure that the vehicle reaches the target set by $t=0$ for any allowed tracking error.}
