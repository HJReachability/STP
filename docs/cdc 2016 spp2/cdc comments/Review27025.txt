Comments to the author
======================

This paper investigates the safe sequential path planning
of multi-vehicle systems with disturbances and imperfect
information, and the Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis
is given. Three different methods of generating induced
obstacles in the sequential path planning method are
proposed. 

The contribution of the paper is not clear, the authors
should provide a comparison of contribution with their
previous work and the existing results in the literature.
