Comments to the author
======================

The paper proposes a prioritized algorithm for path
planning of vehicles affected by disturbances, using a 
Hamilton-Jacobi based reachability analysis. Low priority
vehicles treat high priority ones as time-varying induced
obstacles. The definition of these obstacle regions is
performed again via reachability, by defining an
appropriate auxiliary problem.

This is an application paper that relies strongly on
earlier work by the same authors and a combination of
existing results in 
the literature. My comments are the following:

1) The idea of using an auxiliary reachability problem to
identify obstacle or maneuverability envelopes is not
novel. This has been already employed in [Kitsios, Lygeros,
CDC 2005], [Panagou etal, CDC 2009].
Also gaming formulations in a HJ context are well known.

2) The double obstacle reachability problem, for which the
authors refer to their earlier work in [17] has already
appeared in the literature in [15], [16], and the authors
should refer to these references as well.
Moreover, the case of time-varying obstacles has been
considered in [Bokanowski, Zidani, IFAC 2011] and 
in [Margellos, Lygeros, IEEE TCST 2013]; in both these
references the authors augment the state with \dot{t}=1 to
inherit the proofs but then one need not append the
additional "timer" equation when performing the
reachability calculations.

3) In eq. 4 a more traditional definition would be to write
"\forall \gamma(\cdot), \exists u ... ", where now
\gamma(\cdot) is the strategy of the adversarial player.
Having the order of the quantifiers reversed implies that
\gamma(u) are the valuations of the strategy for the given
u. The min-max order in the Hamiltonian would remain the
same; this would be coherent 
with traditional representations. 

4) Minor comment: The "x" variables in (6) should be
replaced by "z".

For the above reasons, the contribution of the paper
compared to existing results in the literature and previous
applications by the authors is not clear.
