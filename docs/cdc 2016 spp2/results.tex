\section{Numerical Simulations \label{sec:sim}}
We demonstrate our proposed method using a four-vehicle example. Each vehicle has the following simple mode:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dyn_i}
\begin{aligned}
\dot{p}_{x,i} &= v_i \cos \theta_i \\
\dot{p}_{y,i} &= v_i \sin \theta_i \\
\dot{\theta}_i &= \omega_i, \\
\underline{v} &\le v_i \le \bar{v}, |\omega_i| \le \bar{\omega}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $p_i = (p_{x,i}, p_{y,i})$ represent vehicle $\veh_i$'s position, and $\theta_i$ represents $\veh_i$'s heading. The control of $\veh_i$ is $u_i = (v_i, \omega_i)$, where $v_i$ is the speed of $\veh_i$ and $\omega_i$ is the turn rate; both controls have a lower and upper bound. For illustration purposes, we chose $\underline{v} = 0.5, \bar{v} = 1, \bar\omega = 1$.
