\section{Numerical Simulations \label{sec:sim}}
We demonstrate our proposed methods using a four-vehicle example. Each vehicle has the following simple mode:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dyn_i}
\begin{aligned}
\dot{p}_{x,i} &= v_i \cos \theta_i \\
\dot{p}_{y,i} &= v_i \sin \theta_i \\
\dot{\theta}_i &= \omega_i, \\
\underline{v} &\le v_i \le \bar{v}, |\omega_i| \le \bar{\omega}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $p_i = (p_{x,i}, p_{y,i})$ represent vehicle $\veh_i$'s position, and $\theta_i$ represents $\veh_i$'s heading. The control of $\veh_i$ is $u_i = (v_i, \omega_i)$, where $v_i$ is the speed of $\veh_i$ and $\omega_i$ is the turn rate; both controls have a lower and upper bound. For illustration purposes, we chose $\underline{v} = 0.5, \bar{v} = 1, \bar\omega = 1$; however, our method can easily handle the case in which these inputs differ across vehicles. The optimal control for vehicle $i$ can be obtained by optimizing the associated Hamiltonian, $\ham_i(t, D_{\x_i}\soln_i(\x_i,t), \soln_i(\x_i,t))$, and is given by:
%
%\bq
%\begin{aligned}
%\ham_i(t, &D_{\x_i}\soln_i(\x_i,t), \soln_i(\x_i,t)) \\
%&= \min_i \big\{ v_i D_{x_i} \soln_i(\x_i, t) \cos(x_i(t)) \\
%&\; + v_i D_{y_i} \soln_i(\x_i, t) \sin(y_i(t)) + D_{\theta_i} \soln_i(\x_i, t) \omega_i \big\}
%\end{aligned}
%\eq
%
%\noindent giving the optimal control
\bq
\omega_i(t) = -\bar{\omega}_i\frac{D_{\theta_i}\soln_i(\x_i,t)}{\left| D_{\theta_i}\soln_i(\x_i,t) \right|},
