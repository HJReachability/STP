\subsection{Least Restrictive Control}
Fig. \ref{fig:lrc_traj} shows the simulated trajectories in the situation where each vehicle assumes that higher priority vehicles use the least restrictive control to reach their targets, as described in \ref{sec:lrc}. Fig. \ref{fig:lrc_rs3} shows the BRS and induced obstacles for the green vehicle, which has the 3rd highest priority.

The red vehicle has the highest priority, and takes a quick path to reach its target. From the perspective of all the other vehicles, large obstacles are induced by the red vehicle, since lower priority vehicles make the weak assumption that higher priority vehicles are using the least restrictive control. Because the obstacles induced by higher priority vehicles are so large, it is faster for lower priority vehicles to wait until higher priority vehicles pass by than to move around the higher priority vehicles. As a result, the vehicles never form a dense configuration, and their trajectories are relatively straight, indicating that they end up taking a short path to the target after higher priority vehicles pass by.

From the green vehicle's perspective, the large obstacles induced by the red and blue vehicles are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lrc_rs3} as the black boundary. As the BRS (green) evolves over time, its growth gets inhibited by the large obstacle for a long time, from $t=-0.89$ to $t=-1.39$. Eventually, the boundary of the BRS reaches the initial state of the green vehicle at $t = \ldt_i = -2.66$.
