\subsection{Least Restrictive Control}
Fig. \ref{fig:lrc_traj} shows the simulated trajectories in the situation where each vehicle assumes that higher priority vehicles use the least restrictive control to reach their targets, as described in \ref{sec:lrc}. 

Here, the red vehicle has the highest priority, and takes a quick path to reach its target. But as
