\subsection{SPP Without Disturbances and Intruder\label{sec:basic}}
In this section, we give an overview of the basic SPP algorithm assuming that there is no disturbance and intruder affecting the vehicles. Although in practice, such assumptions do not hold, the description of the basic SPP algorithm will introduce the notation needed for describing the subsequent, more realistic versions of SPP. The majority of the content in this section is taken from \cite{Chen15c}.

Recall that the SPP vehicles $\veh_i, i=1,\ldots,N$, are each assigned a strict priority, with $\veh_j$ having a higher priority than $\veh_i$ if $j<i$. In the absence of disturbances, we can write the dynamics of the SPP vehicles as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dyn_no_dstb}
\begin{aligned}
\dot\state_i &= \fdyn_i(\state_i, \ctrl_i), t \le \sta_i \\
\ctrl_i &\in \cset_i, \qquad i = 1 \ldots, \N
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

In SPP, each vehicle $\veh_i$ plans the trajectory to its target set $\targetset_i$ while avoiding static obstacles $\soset_i$ and the obstacles $\ioset_i^j(t)$ induced by higher-priority vehicles $\veh_j, j<i$. Trajectory planning is done sequentially starting from the first vehicle and proceeding in descending priority, $\veh_1, \veh_2, \ldots, \veh_{\N}$ so that each of the trajectory planning problems can be done in the state space of only one vehicle. During its trajectory planning process, $\veh_i$ ignores the presence of lower-priority vehicles $\veh_k, k>i$, and induces the obstacles $\ioset_k^i(t)$ for $\veh_k, k>i$.

From the perspective of $\veh_i$, each of the higher-priority vehicles $\veh_j, j<i$ induces a time-varying obstacle denoted $\ioset_i^j(t)$ that $\veh_i$ needs to avoid. Therefore, each vehicle $\veh_i$ must plan its trajectory to $\targetset_i$ while avoiding the union of all the induced obstacles as well as the static obstacles. Let $\obsset_i(t)$ be the union of all the obstacles that $\veh_i$ must avoid on its way to $\targetset_i$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:obsseti}
\obsset_i(t)  = \soset_i \cup \bigcup_{j=1}^{i-1} \ioset_i^j(t)
\end{equation}

With full position information of higher priority vehicles, the obstacle induced for $\veh_i$ by $\veh_j$ is simply
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ioset_basic}
\ioset_i^j(t) = \{\state_i: \|\pos_i - \pos_j(t)\|_2 \le \rc \}
\end{equation}

Each higher priority vehicle $\veh_j$ plans its trajectory while ignoring $\veh_i$. Since trajectory planning is done sequentially in descending order or priority, the vehicles $\veh_j, j<i$ would have planned their trajectories before $\veh_i$ does. Thus, in the absence of disturbances, $\pos_j(t)$ is \textit{a priori} known, and therefore $\ioset_i^j(t), j<i$ are known, deterministic moving obstacles, which means that $\obsset_i(t)$ is also known and deterministic. Therefore, the trajectory planning problem for $\veh_i$ can be solved by first computing the BRS $\brs_i^\text{basic}(t, \sta_i)$, defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:BRS_basic}
\begin{aligned}
\brs_i^\text{basic}(t, \sta_i) = & \{y: \exists \ctrl_i(\cdot) \in \cfset_i, \state_i(\cdot) \text{ satisfies \eqref{eq:dyn_no_dstb}}, \\
& \forall s \in [t, \sta_i],\state_i(s) \notin \obsset_i(s), \\
& \exists s \in [t, \sta_i], \state_i(s) \in \targetset_i, \state_i(t) = y\}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The BRS $\brs(t, \sta_i)$ can be obtained by solving \eqref{eq:HJIVI_BRS} with $\targetset = \targetset_i$, $\obsset(t) = \obsset_i(t)$, and the Hamiltonian 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:basicham}
\ham_i^\text{basic}(\state_i, \costate) = \min_{\ctrl_i\in\cset_i} \costate \cdot \fdyn_i(\state_i, \ctrl_i)
\end{equation}

The optimal control for reaching $\targetset_i$ while avoiding $\obsset_i(t)$ is then given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:basicOptCtrl}
\ctrl_i^\text{basic}(t, \state_i) = \arg \min_{\ctrl_i\in\cset_i} \costate \cdot \fdyn_i(\state_i, \ctrl_i)
\end{equation}
\noindent from which the trajectory $\state_i(\cdot)$ can be computed by integrating the system dynamics, which in this case are given by \eqref{eq:dyn_no_dstb}. In addition, the latest departure time $\ldt_i$ can be obtained from the BRS $\brs(t, \sta_i)$ as $\ldt_i = \arg \sup_t \{\state_i^0 \in \brs(t, \sta_i)\}$. In summary, the basic SPP algorithm is given as follows:
