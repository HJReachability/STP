\subsubsection{Separation region} \label{sec:sepRegion_case2}
Similar to Section \ref{sec:sepRegion_case2}, we want to compute the set of all states $\state_{\intr}(\tsa_j)$ for which $\veh_j$ is forced to apply an avoidance maneuver. Since, $\veh_j$ applies the avoidance maneuver after $\veh_i$ in this case, $\veh_j$ will need to avoid the intruder for a maximum duration of $\trd := \iat - \brd$. This is due to the fact that our design of the buffer region in Section \ref{sec:buffRegion_case2} ensures that it takes $\veh_{\intr}$ at least a duration of $\brd$ to go from the boundary of the avoid region of $\veh_i$ to that of $\veh_j$. $\sep_j(\tsa_j)$ can thus be obtained as:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:sepRegion_case2}
\sep_j(\tsa_j) = \boset_j(\tsa_j) + \partial \brs^{\text{A}}_{j}(0, \trd).
\end{equation}
