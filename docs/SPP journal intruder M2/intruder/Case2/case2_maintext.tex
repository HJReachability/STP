\subsection{Separation and Buffer Regions - Case 2} \label{sec:case2_maintext}
We now consider Case 2: $\tsa_i < \tsa_j, \tsa_i <\infty$. In this case, the intruder forces $\veh_i$, the lower-priority vehicle, to apply avoidance control before $\veh_j$, the higher-priority vehicle.  We compute the separation region, the buffer region and the obstacles for $\veh_i$ similar to that in Case 1. The buffer region for Case 2 is denoted as $\buff_{ji}(t)$ to differentiate it from the Case 1 buffer region. Similarly, the obstacles for Case 2 are denoted as $_2^A\ioset_i^j(t)$ and $_2^B\ioset_i^j(t)$, corresponding to the two cases similar to that in Section \eqref{sec:intruderObs_case1}. The computation of these sets for Case 2 is very similar to that of Case 1 and has been moved to Appendix.
