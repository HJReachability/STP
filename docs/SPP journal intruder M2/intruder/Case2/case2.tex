\subsection{Separation and Buffer Regions - Case 2} \label{sec:case2}
In this section, we consider Case 2: $\tsa_i < \tsa_j, \tsa_i <\infty$. In this case, the intruder forces $\veh_i$ to apply avoidance control before $\veh_j$. The analysis in this case is fairly similar to Case 1. There are a few differences however, which we point out wherever relevant. We start with an observation similar to Observation \ref{obs1_case1}:
\begin{observation} \label{obs1_case2}
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $\state_{\intr, i}(\tsa) \in \partial \brs^{\text{A}}_{i}(0, \iat)$. Equivalently, we can assume that $\tsa_i = \tsa$.
\end{observation}
