\subsection{Separation and Buffer Regions - Case 2} \label{sec:case2}
In this section, we consider Case 2: $\tsa_i < \tsa_j, \tsa_i <\infty$. In this case, the intruder forces $\veh_i$, the lower-priority vehicle, to apply an avoidance maneuver before $\veh_j$, the higher-priority vehicle. The analysis in this case is similar to that of Case 1 (Section \ref{sec:case1}). However, there are a few subtle differences, which we point out wherever relevant. We start our analysis with an observation similar to Observation \ref{obs1_case1}:
\begin{observation} \label{obs1_case2}
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $\state_{\intr, i}(\tsa) \in \partial \brs^{\text{A}}_{i}(0, \iat)$. Equivalently, we can assume that $\tsa_i = \tsa$.
\end{observation}
