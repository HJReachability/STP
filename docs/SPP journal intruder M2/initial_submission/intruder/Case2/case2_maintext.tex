\subsection{Separation and Buffer Regions - Case 2} \label{sec:case2_maintext}
We now consider Case 2: $\tsa_i < \tsa_j, \tsa_i <\infty$. In this case, the intruder forces $\veh_i$, the lower-priority vehicle, to apply avoidance control before $\veh_j$, the higher-priority vehicle. 
The separation region, the buffer region and the obstacles in this case can be computed in a similar manner to that in Case 1.
The buffer region in this case is denoted as $\buff_{ji}(t)$ to differentiate it from Case 1 (i.e., the order of $i$ and $j$ indexes has been switched). 
Similarly, the obstacles for Case 2 are denoted as $_2^A\ioset_i^j(t)$ and $_2^B\ioset_i^j(t)$, corresponding to the two cases similar to that in Section \eqref{sec:intruderObs_case1}. 
For brevity purposes, these computations are presented in the extended version of this paper \cite{current_axriv} (also included in the supplementary material).
