\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}
Recently, there has been an immense surge of interest in the use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) for civil applications. The applications include package delivery, aerial surveillance, disaster response, among many others \cite{Tice91, Debusk10, Amazon16, AUVSI16, BBC16}. These civil applications will involve unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying in urban environments, potentially in close proximity of humans, other UAVs, and other important assets. As a result, government agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States are urgently trying to develop new scalable ways to organize an airspace in which potentially thousands of UAVs can fly together \cite{FAA13, Kopardekar16}.

One essential problem that needs to be addressed for this endeavour to be successful is that of trajectory planning: how a group of vehicles in the same vicinity can reach their destinations while avoiding situations which are considered dangerous, such as collisions. Many previous studies address this problem under different assumptions. In some studies, specific control strategies for the vehicles are assumed, and approaches such as those involving induced velocity obstacles \cite{Fiorini98, Chasparis05, Vandenberg08,Wu2012} and involving virtual potential fields to maintain collision avoidance \cite{Olfati-Saber2002, Chuang07} have been used. Methods have also been proposed for real-time trajectory generation \cite{Feng-LiLian2002}, for path planning for vehicles with linear dynamics in the presence of obstacles with known motion \cite{Ahmadzadeh2009}, and for cooperative path planning via waypoints which do not account for vehicle dynamics \cite{Bellingham}. Other related work include those which consider only the collision avoidance problem without path planning. These results include those that assume the system has a linear model \cite{Beard2003, Schouwenaars2004, Stipanovic2007}, rely on a linearization of the system model \cite{Massink2001, Althoff2011}, assume a simple positional state space \cite{Lin2015}, and many others \cite{Lalish2008, Hoffmann2008, Chen2016}.

However, to make sure that a dense group of UAVs can safely fly in the close vicinity of each other, we need the capability to flexibly plan provably safe and dynamically feasible trajectories without making strong assumptions on the vehicles' dynamics and other vehicles' motion. Moreover, any trajectory planning scheme that addresses collision avoidance must also guarantee both goal satisfaction and safety of UAVs despite disturbances caused by wind and communication faults \cite{Kopardekar16}. Furthermore, unexpected scenarios such as UAV malfunctions or even UAVs with malicious intent need to be accounted for. Finally, the proposed scheme should scale well with the number of vehicles.

The problem of trajectory planning and collision avoidance under disturbances in safety-critical systems has been studied using Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which provides guarantees on goal satisfaction and safety of optimal system trajectories \cite{Barron90, Mitchell05, Bokanowski10, Bokanowski11, Margellos11, Fisac15}. Reachability-based methods are particularly suitable in the context of UAVs because of the hard guarantees that are provided. In reachability analysis, one computes the reach-avoid set, defined as the set of states from which the system can be driven to a target set while satisfying (possibly time-varying) state constraints at all times. A major practical appeal of this approach stems from the availability of modern numerical tools, which can compute various definitions of reachable sets \cite{Sethian96, Osher02, Mitchell02, Mitchell07b}. These numerical tools, for example, have been successfully used to solve a variety of differential games, path planning problems, and optimal control problems. Concrete practical applications include aircraft auto-landing \cite{Bayen07}, automated aerial refueling \cite{Ding08}, MPC control of quadrotors \cite{Bouffard12}, and multiplayer reach-avoid games \cite{Huang11}. Despite its power, the approach becomes numerically intractable as the state space dimension increases. In particular, reachable set computations involve solving a HJ partial differential equation (PDE) or variational inequality (VI) on a grid representing a discretization of the state space, resulting in an \textit{exponential} scaling of computational complexity with respect to the dimensionality of the problem. Therefore, as such, dynamic programming-based approaches such as reachability analysis are not suitable for managing the next generation airspace, which is a large-scale system with a high-dimensional joint state space because of the high density of vehicles that needs to be accommodated \cite{Kopardekar16}.  

To overcome this problem, Sequential Path Planning (SPP) method has been proposed \cite{Chen15c}, in which vehicles are assigned a strict priority ordering. Higher-priority vehicles plan their paths without taking into account the lower-priority vehicles. Lower-priority vehicles treat higher-priority vehicles as moving obstacles. Under this assumption, time-varying formulations of reachability \cite{Bokanowski11, Fisac15} can be used to obtain the optimal and provably safe paths for each vehicle, starting from the highest-priority vehicle. Thus, the curse of dimensionality is overcome for the multi-vehicle path planning problem at the cost of a mild structural assumption, under which the computation complexity scales just \textit{linearly} with the number of vehicles. %Authors in \cite{Bansal2017} and \cite{chen2016robust}, respectively, extend this method to the scenarios where disturbances and adversarial intruders are present in the system, resolving some of the practical challenges associated with the basic SPP algorithm in \cite{Chen15c}. 
Authors in \cite{Bansal2017} extend this method to the scenarios where disturbances, such as wind, are present in the system, resolving some of the practical challenges associated with the basic SPP algorithm in \cite{Chen15c}. However, if a vehicle not in the set of SPP vehicles enters the system, or even worse, if this vehicle has malicious intent, the original plan can lead to vehicles entering into another vehicleâ€™s danger zone. Thus, if vehicles do not plan with an additional safety margin that takes a potential intruder into account, a vehicle trying to avoid the intruder may effectively become an intruder itself, leading to a domino effect, causing the entire SPP structure to collapse. Authors in \cite{chen2016robust}, propose an SPP algorithm that accounts for such a potential intruder.

One of the limitations of the SPP algorithm proposed in \cite{chen2016robust} is that a full-scale new path planning problem is required to be solved in real time to ensure a safe trasit of the SPP vehicles to their respective destinations. Since the replanning is done in real-time, the proposed algorithm is intractable for large-scale systems even with the SPP structure, rendering the method unsuitable for practical implementation. In this work, we propose a novel intruder avoidance algorithm, which will need to replan trajectories only for a fixed number of vehicles if the intruder appears in the system, irrespective of the total number of SPP vehicles. Moreover, this number is a design parameter, which can be chosen beforehand based on the computation resources available during the run time, thus overcoming the limitations of the algorithm in \cite{chen2016robust}. Finally, we illustrate this algorithm through a fifty-vehicle simulation in an urban environment, demonstrating the scalability of the proposed algorithm. 

Rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section \ref{sec:formulation}, we formally present the SPP problem in the presence of disturbances and adversarial intruders. In Section \ref{sec:background}, we present a brief review of time-varying reachability, the basic SPP algorithms proposed in \cite{Chen15c}, \cite{Bansal2017}. In Section \ref{sec:intruder}, a novel algorithm to account for intruders has been proposed. All simulation results are in Section \ref{sec:simulations}.
