\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}
Recently, there has been an immense surge of interest in the use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) for civil applications \cite{Tice91, Debusk10, Amazon16, AUVSI16, BBC16}, which will involve unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying in urban environments, potentially in close proximity to humans, other UAVs, and other important assets. As a result, new scalable ways to organize an airspace are required in which potentially thousands of UAVs can fly together \cite{FAA13, Kopardekar16}.
%government agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States are urgently trying to develop new scalable ways to organize an airspace in which potentially thousands of UAVs can fly together \cite{FAA13, Kopardekar16}.

One essential problem that needs to be addressed for this endeavor to be successful is that of trajectory planning: how a group of vehicles in the same vicinity can reach their destinations while avoiding situations which are considered dangerous, such as collisions. Many previous studies address this problem under different assumptions. In some studies, specific control strategies for the vehicles are assumed, and approaches such as those involving induced velocity obstacles \cite{Fiorini98, Chasparis05, Vandenberg08,Wu2012} and those involving virtual potential fields to maintain collision avoidance \cite{Olfati-Saber2002, Chuang07} have been used. Methods have also been proposed for real-time trajectory generation \cite{Feng-LiLian2002}, for path planning for vehicles with linear dynamics in the presence of obstacles with known motion \cite{Ahmadzadeh2009}, and for cooperative path planning via waypoints which do not account for vehicle dynamics \cite{Bellingham}. Other related work is in the collision avoidance problem without path planning. These results include those that assume the system has a linear model \cite{Beard2003, Schouwenaars2004, Stipanovic2007}, rely on a linearization of the system model \cite{Massink2001, Althoff2011}, assume a simple positional state space \cite{Lin2015}, and many others \cite{Lalish2008, Hoffmann2008, Chen2016}.

However, methods to flexibly plan provably safe and dynamically feasible trajectories without making strong assumptions on the vehicles' dynamics and other vehicles' motion are lacking. Moreover, any trajectory planning scheme that addresses collision avoidance must also guarantee both goal satisfaction and safety of UAVs despite disturbances and communication faults \cite{Kopardekar16}. Furthermore, unexpected scenarios such as UAV malfunctions or even UAVs with malicious intent need to be accounted for. Finally, the proposed scheme should scale well with the number of vehicles.

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based methods \cite{Barron90, Mitchell05, Bokanowski10, Bokanowski11, Margellos11, Fisac15} are particularly suitable in the context of UAVs because of the formal guarantees provided. In this context, one computes the reach-avoid set, defined as the set of states from which the system can be driven to a target set while satisfying time-varying state constraints at all times. A major practical appeal of this approach stems from the availability of modern numerical tools which can compute various definitions of reachable sets \cite{Sethian96, Osher02, Mitchell02, Mitchell07b}. These numerical tools, for example, have been successfully used to solve a variety of differential games, trajectory planning problems, and optimal control problems \cite{Bayen07, Ding08, Bouffard12, Huang11}. 
%Concrete practical applications include aircraft auto-landing \cite{Bayen07}, automated aerial refueling \cite{Ding08}, safe control of quadrotors \cite{Bouffard12}, and multiplayer reach-avoid games \cite{Huang11}. 
However, reachable set computations involve solving a HJ partial differential equation (PDE) or variational inequality (VI) on a grid representing a discretization of the state space, resulting in an \textit{exponential} scaling of computational complexity with respect to the system dimensionality. Therefore, reachability analysis or other dynamic programming-based methods alone are not suitable for managing the next generation airspace, which is a large-scale system with a high-dimensional joint state space because of the possible high density of vehicles that needs to be accommodated \cite{Kopardekar16}.  

To overcome this problem, the priority-based Sequential Trajectory Planning (STP) method has been proposed \cite{Chen15c, Bansal2017}. In this context, higher-priority vehicles plan their trajectories without taking into account the lower-priority vehicles, and lower-priority vehicles treat higher-priority vehicles as moving obstacles. Under this assumption, time-varying formulations of reachability \cite{Bokanowski11, Fisac15} can be used to obtain the optimal and provably safe trajectories for each vehicle, starting from the highest-priority vehicle. Thus, the curse of dimensionality is overcome at the cost of a structural assumption, under which the computation complexity scales just \textit{linearly} with the number of vehicles. In addition, such a structure has the potential to flexibly divide up the airspace for the use of many UAVs and allows tractable multi-vehicle trajectory-planning. Practically, different economic mechanisms can be used to establish a priority order. One example could be first-come-first-serve mechanism, as highlighted in NASA's concept of operations for UAS traffic management \cite{Kopardekar16}.

%The authors in \cite{Bansal2017} extend the STP method to the scenarios where disturbances, such as wind, are present in the system, resolving some of the practical challenges associated with the basic STP algorithm in \cite{Chen15c}. 
However, if a vehicle not in the set of STP vehicles enters the system, or even worse, if this vehicle has malicious intent, the original plan can lead to a vehicle colliding with another vehicle, leading to a domino effect, causing the entire STP structure to collapse. Thus, STP vehicles must plan with an additional safety margin that takes a potential intruder into account. The authors in \cite{Chen2016d} propose an STP algorithm that accounts for such a potential intruder. However, a new full-scale trajectory planning problem is required to be solved in real time to ensure safe transit of the vehicles to their respective destinations. Since the replanning must be done in real-time, the proposed algorithm in \cite{Chen2016d} is intractable for large-scale systems even with the STP structure. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that limits the replanning to a \textit{fixed number of vehicles}, irrespective of the total number of STP vehicles. Moreover, this design parameter can be chosen beforehand based on the computational resources available. 

Intuitively, for every vehicle, we compute a \textit{separation region} such that the vehicle needs to account for the intruder if and only if the intruder is inside this separation region. We then compute a \textit{buffer region} between the separation regions of any two vehicles, and ensure that this buffer is maintained as vehicles are traveling to their destinations. Thus, to intrude every additional vehicle, the intruder must travel through the buffer region. Therefore, we can design the buffer region size such that the intruder can affect at most a specified number of vehicles within some duration. A high-level overview of the proposed algorithm is provided in Algorithm \ref{alg:basic_idea}.

In Section \ref{sec:formulation}, we formalize the STP problem in the presence of disturbances and adversarial intruders. In Section \ref{sec:background}, we present an overview of time-varying reachability and basic STP algorithms in \cite{Chen15c}, \cite{Bansal2017}. In Section \ref{sec:intruder}, we present our proposed algorithm. Finally, we illustrate this algorithm through a fifty-vehicle simulation in an urban environment in Section \ref{sec:simulations}.
