\section{Background \label{sec:background}}
In this sections, we present the SPP algorithm under different assumptions. We begin with the basic SPP algorithm in which disturbances are ignored and perfect information of vehicles' positions is assumed. This simplification allows us to clearly present the basic SPP algorithm. Next, we present the robust trajectory tracking algorithm that can be used to make basic SPP approach robust to disturbances as well as an imperfect knowledge of other vehicles' positions. In the next section, we will present an algorithm to further robustify the SPP approach by considering how the set of SPP vehicles may respond to the presence of an intruder vehicle which may be adversarial. All of the above algorithms use time-varying reachability analysis to provide goal satisfaction and safety guarantees; therefore, we start with an overview of time-varying reachability.
