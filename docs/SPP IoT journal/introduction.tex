\section{Introduction}

Focus on the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Present a powerful theory for robust path planning. Focus on explicitly pointing out the limitations of the intruder Method-1 and how we are addressing them in the current paper. 
\item Demonstrate the scaling of the theory.
\item Provide some more intuition about the solution that emerge out of theory-- Space-time separation, buffer region between vehicles, trajectories, etc.
\item Explaining how this solution change with the space structure (city vs bay area) and with the disturbance bounds.
\item Zero communication overhead due to the presence of a feedback law! (Important based on IoT Journal description).
\end{itemize}
