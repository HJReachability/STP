\textbf{To-Dos:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A remark about the single vehicle replanning property of Method-2. Moreover, Method-2 can, in theory, handle multiple intruders as long as they are affecting different vehicles. Though, we have to replan for several vehicles in that case. 
\item Once the replanning is complete, another intruder can appear in the system. So strictly speaking we are making an assumption that atmost one intruder is in the system \textit{at any given time} as opposed to throughout the trajectory.
\item For method-2 results, it may be helpful to include a figure which is showing the division of space among vehicles at some time (probably right before the intruder enters). 
\end{itemize}
