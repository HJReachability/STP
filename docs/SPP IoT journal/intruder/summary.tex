\textbf{To-Dos:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A remark about the single vehicle replanning property of Method-2.
\item Once the replanning is complete, another intruder can appear in the system. So strictly speaking we are making an assumption that atmost one intruder is in the system \textit{at any given time} as opposed to throughout the trajectory.
\item For method-2 results, it may be helpful to include a figure which is showing the division of space among vehicles at some time (probably right before the intruder enters). 
\end{itemize}
