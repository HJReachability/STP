\section{Background \label{sec:background}}
In this section, we present the basic STP algorithm \cite{Chen15c} in which disturbances are ignored and perfect information of vehiclesâ€™ positions is assumed. This simplification allows us to clearly present the basic STP algorithm. However, in presence of disturbances, it is no longer possible to commit to exact trajectories (and hence positions), since the disturbance $\dstb_i(\cdot)$ is \textit{a priori} unknown. Thus, disturbances and incomplete information significantly complicate the STP scheme. We next present the robust trajectory tracking algorithm \cite{Bansal2017} that can be used to make basic STP approach robust to disturbances as well as to an imperfect knowledge of other vehicles' positions. All of these algorithms use time-varying reachability analysis to provide goal satisfaction and safety guarantees; therefore, we start with an overview of time-varying reachability.
