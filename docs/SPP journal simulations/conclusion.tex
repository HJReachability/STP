\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
%We propose an algorithm to account for an adversarial intruder in sequential path planning. All vehicles are guaranteed to successfully reach their respective destinations without entering each other's danger zones despite the worst-case disturbance and the intruder attack the vehicles could experience.The proposed method ensures that only a fixed number of vehicles need to replan their trajectories once the intruder disappears, irrespective of total number of vehicles. Moreover, this fixed number is an input to the algorithm and hence can be chosen such that the replanning process is feasible in real-time. The proposed method is illustrated in a fifty-vehicle simulation, set in the urban environment of San Francisco city in California, US. Future work includes exploring methods that can account for multiple simultaneous intruders and can reduce conservatism in the current analysis.
