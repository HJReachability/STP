\section{Conclusion}
Provably safe multi-vehicle trajectory planning in an important problem that needs to be addressed to ensure that vehicles can fly in close proximity of each other. Recently, the STP algorithm was proposed for multi-vehicle trajectory planning problem that scales linearly with the number of vehicles. We illustrate the full potential of the algorithm by using it for large-scale multi-vehicle trajectory planning problems under different flying conditions. We demonstrate how different types of space-time trajectories emerge naturally out of the algorithm for different disturbance conditions and other problem parameters. The reactivity of the obtained controller is also demonstrated under different wind conditions.
