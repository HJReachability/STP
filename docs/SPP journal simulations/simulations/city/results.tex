\subsection{Results \label{sec:city_simResults}}

Focus on the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item The technical details for the simulations, like RTT parameters, relative co-ordinate dynamics, rotation and translation of obstacles, union for obstacles, etc. 
\item Demonstration of theory (the vehicles avoid collision w/ other vehicles and reach their destinations).
\item Scaling of SPP.
\item Provide some more intuition about the solution that emerge out of theory-- Space-time separation, type of space-time trajectories (Almost straight line path w/ different starting times?), etc.
\item Reactivity of controller to the actual disturbance (Claire: be very detailed about explaining the setup of simulation)
\item Illustrate how the type of space-time trajectories change with change in disturbance bounds and STA
\end{itemize}
