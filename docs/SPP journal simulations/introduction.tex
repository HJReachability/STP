\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}
Recently, there has been an immense surge of interest in the use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) for civil applications. The applications include package delivery, aerial surveillance, disaster response, among many others \cite{Tice91, Debusk10, Amazon16, AUVSI16, BBC16}. Unlike previous uses of UASs for military purposes, civil applications will involve unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying in urban environments, potentially in close proximity of humans, other UAVs, and other important assets. As a result, government agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States are urgently trying to develop new scalable ways to organize an airspace in which potentially thousands of UAVs can fly together \cite{FAA13, Kopardekar16}.

One essential problem that needs to be addressed for this endeavour to be successful is that of trajectory planning: how a group of vehicles in the same vicinity can reach their destinations while avoiding situations which are considered dangerous, such as collisions. Many previous studies address this problem under different assumptions. In some studies, specific control strategies for the vehicles are assumed, and approaches such as those involving induced velocity obstacles \cite{Fiorini98, Chasparis05, Vandenberg08,Wu2012} and involving virtual potential fields to maintain collision avoidance \cite{Olfati-Saber2002, Chuang07} have been used. Methods have also been proposed for real-time trajectory generation \cite{Feng-LiLian2002}, for path planning for vehicles with linear dynamics in the presence of obstacles with known motion \cite{Ahmadzadeh2009}, and for cooperative path planning via waypoints which do not account for vehicle dynamics \cite{Bellingham}. Other related work include those which consider only the collision avoidance problem without path planning. These results include those that assume the system has a linear model \cite{Beard2003, Schouwenaars2004, Stipanovic2007}, rely on a linearization of the system model \cite{Massink2001, Althoff2011}, assume a simple positional state space \cite{Lin2015}, and many others \cite{Lalish2008, Hoffmann2008, Chen2016}.

However, to make sure that a dense group of UAVs can safely fly in the close vicinity of each other, we need the capability to flexibly plan provably safe and dynamically feasible trajectories without making strong assumptions on the vehicles' dynamics and other vehicles' motion. Moreover, any trajectory planning scheme that addresses collision avoidance must also guarantee both goal satisfaction and safety of UAVs despite disturbances caused by wind and communication faults \cite{Kopardekar16}. Finally, the proposed scheme should scale well with the number of vehicles.

The problem of trajectory planning and collision avoidance under disturbances in safety-critical systems has been studied using Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which provides guarantees on goal satisfaction and safety of optimal system trajectories \cite{Barron90, Mitchell05, Bokanowski10, Bokanowski11, Margellos11, Fisac15}. Reachability-based methods are particularly suitable in the context of UAVs because of the hard guarantees that are provided. In reachability analysis, one computes the reach-avoid set, defined as the set of states from which the system can be driven to a target set while satisfying (possibly time-varying) state constraints at all times. A major practical appeal of this approach stems from the availability of modern numerical tools, which can compute various definitions of reachable sets \cite{Sethian96, Osher02, Mitchell02, Mitchell07b}. These numerical tools, for example, have been successfully used to solve a variety of differential games, path planning problems, and optimal control problems. Concrete practical applications include aircraft auto-landing \cite{Bayen07}, automated aerial refueling \cite{Ding08}, MPC control of quadrotors \cite{Bouffard12}, and multiplayer reach-avoid games \cite{Huang11}. Despite its power, the approach becomes numerically intractable as the state space dimension increases. In particular, reachable set computations involve solving a HJ partial differential equation (PDE) or variational inequality (VI) on a grid representing a discretization of the state space, resulting in an \textit{exponential} scaling of computational complexity with respect to the dimensionality of the problem. Therefore, as such, dynamic programming-based approaches such as reachability analysis are not suitable for managing the next generation airspace, which is a large-scale system with a high-dimensional joint state space because of the high density of vehicles that needs to be accommodated \cite{Kopardekar16}.  

To overcome this problem, Sequential Path Planning (SPP) method has been proposed \cite{Chen15c}, in which vehicles are assigned a strict priority ordering. Higher-priority vehicles plan their paths without taking into account the lower-priority vehicles. Lower-priority vehicles treat higher-priority vehicles as moving obstacles. Under this assumption, time-varying formulations of reachability \cite{Bokanowski11, Fisac15} can be used to obtain the optimal and provably safe paths for each vehicle, starting from the highest-priority vehicle. Thus, the curse of dimensionality is overcome for the multi-vehicle path planning problem at the cost of a mild structural assumption, under which the computation complexity scales just \textit{linearly} with the number of vehicles. Intuitively, SPP algorithm allocates a space-time trajectory to each vehicle based on their priorities. The highest priority vehicle gets to choose whatever space-time trajectory is optimal for it. The next vehicle can also choose its optimal trajectory but such that it doesn't intersect with the trajectory of the highest priority vehicle, and so on. Hence two vehicles can either follow same state tarjectory but at different times (referred to as \textit{time-separated} trajectories here on) or follow different state trajectories but at the same time (referred to as \textit{state-separated} trajectories here on), but not both. Finally, they can have different state trajectories at different times (referred to as \textit{state-time separated} trajectories here on). So by design, SPP algorithm ensures that the space-time trajectories of the vehicles do not intersect, and hence a safe transition to destination is guaranteed.  

Authors in \cite{Bansal2017} and \cite{chen2016robust}, respectively, extend SPP to the scenarios where disturbances and adversarial intruders are present in the system, resolving some of the practical challenges associated with the basic SPP algorithm in \cite{Chen15c}. The focus of these works, however, have mostly been on the theoretical development of SPP algorithm. Our focus in this work is instead on demonstrating the potential of SPP algorithm as a provably safe trajectory planning algorithm for large-scale systems. In particular, our main contributions in this work are:
\begin{itemize}
\item we simulate large-scale multi-vehicle systems in two different urban environments under the presence of disturbances in vehciles' dynamics. First, SPP algorithm is used for trajectory planning at a city level and then at a regional level. For city level planning, we consider the San Francisco city in California, US and for regional level planning we consider the entire Bay area in California, US. The main differences emerge from the fact that the city level planning needs to take into account physcial obstacles (like buildings, etc.), whereas there are fewer obstacles at a regional level, but the origins and destinations are farther apart. In both cases, we demonstrate that SPP algorithm is able to design provably-safe trajectories despite the disturbances.
\item we demonstrate how different types of space-time trajectories emerge automatically out of SPP algorithm between a given pair of origin and destination for different disturbance conditions and other problem parameters.
\item we also show the reactivity of the control law obtained from SPP algorithm, i.e., the obtained control law is able to effectively counter the disturbances in real-time without requiring any communication with other vehicles.      
\end{itemize}

Rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section \ref{sec:formulation}, we formally present the SPP problem in the presence of disturbances. In Section \ref{sec:background}, we present a brief review of time-varying reachability, the basic SPP algorithm \cite{Chen15c} in the absence of disturbances, and the Robust Trajectory Tracking (RTT) method \cite{Bansal2017} to account for disturbances. We also use this algorithm for all our simulations in this paper. All simulation results are in Section \ref{sec:simulations}.
