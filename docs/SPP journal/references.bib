abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle systems are currently in limited use for public service missions worldwide. Development of civil unmanned technology in the United States currently lags behind military unmanned technology development in part because of unresolved regulatory and technological issues. Civil unmanned aerial vehicle systems have potential to augment disaster relief and emergency response efforts. Optimal design of aerial systems for such applications will lead to unmanned vehicles which provide maximum potentiality for relief and emergency response while accounting for public safety concerns and regulatory requirements. A case study is presented that demonstrates application of a civil unmanned system to a disaster relief mission with the intent on saving lives. The concept utilizes unmanned aircraft to obtain advanced warning and damage assessments for tornados and severe thunderstorms. Overview of a tornado watch mission architecture as well as commentary on risk, cost, need for, and design tradeoffs for unmanned aerial systems are provided.

@article{Fiorini98,
abstract = {This paper presents a method for robot motion planning in dynamic environments. It consists of selecting avoidance maneuvers to avoid static and moving obstacles in the velocity space, based on the current positions and velocities of the robot and obstacles. It is a first-order method, since it does not integrate velocities to yield positions as functions of time. The avoidance maneuvers are generated by selecting robot velocities outside of the velocity obstacles, which represent the set of robot velocities that would result in a collision with a given obstacle that moves at a given velocity, at some future time. To ensure that the avoidance maneuver is dynamically feasible, the set of avoidance velocities is intersected with the set of admissible velocities, defined by the robot's acceleration constraints. Computing new avoidance maneuvers at regular time intervals accounts for general obstacle trajectories. The trajectory from start to goal is computed by searching a tree of feasible avoidance maneuvers, computed at discrete time intervals. An exhaustive search of the tree yields near-optimal trajectories that either minimize distance or motion time. A heuristic search of the tree is applicable to on-line planning. The method is demonstrated for point and disk robots among static and moving obstacles, and for an automated vehicle in an intelligent vehicle highway system scenario.},

We consider the case in which each agent navigates independently without explicit communication with other agents. Our formulation is an extension of the Velocity Obstacle concept [3], which was introduced for navigation among (passively) moving obstacles. Our approach takes into account the reactive behavior of the other agents by implicitly assuming that the other agents make a similar collision-avoidance reasoning. We show that this method guarantees safe and oscillation- free motions for each of the agents. We apply our concept to navigation of hundreds of agents in densely populated environments containing both static and moving obstacles, and we show that real-time and scalable performance is achieved in such challenging scenarios.},

Three scenarios of multi-vehicle tasking are proposed at the CPP framework. The NTG algorithm is then used to generate a real time trajectory for desired vehicle activities. Given system dynamics and constraints, the NTG algorithm first finds trajectory curves in a lower dimensional space and then parameterizes the curves by the B-spline basis. The coefficients of the B-splines are further solved by the sequential quadratic programming to satisfy the optimization objectives and constraints. The NTG algorithm has been implemented to generate real-time trajectories for a group of cooperative vehicles in the presence of changing missions and constraints.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT We consider minimal time problems governed by nonlinear systems under general time dependent state constraints and in the two-player games setting. In general, it is known that the characterization of the minimal time function, as well as the study of its regularity properties, is a difficult task in particular when no controllability assumption is made. In addition to these difficulties, we are interested here to the case when the target, the state constraints and the dynamics are allowed to be time-dependent. We introduce a particular “reachability” control problem, which has a supremum cost function but is free of state constraints. This auxiliary control problem allows to characterize easily the backward reachable sets, and then, the minimal time function, without assuming any controllability assumption. These techniques are linked to the well known level-set approaches. Partial results of the study have been published recently by the authors in SICON. Here, we generalize the method to more complex problems of moving target and obstacle problems. Our results can be used to deal with motion planning problems with obstacle avoidance.},

@article{Margellos11,
abstract = {A new framework for formulating reachability problems with competing inputs, nonlinear dynamics and state constraints as optimal control problems is developed. Such reach-avoid problems arise in, among others, the study of safety problems in hybrid systems. Earlier approaches to reach-avoid computations are either restricted to linear systems, or face numerical difficulties due to possible discontinuities in the Hamiltonian of the optimal control problem. The main advantage of the approach proposed in this paper is that it can be applied to a general class of target hitting continuous dynamic games with nonlinear dynamics, and has very good properties in terms of its numerical solution, since the value function and the Hamiltonian of the system are both continuous. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to a two aircraft collision avoidance scenario under target window constraints and in the presence of wind disturbance. Target Windows are a novel concept in air traffic management, and represent spatial and temporal constraints, that the aircraft have to respect to meet their schedule.},

The analysis of this problem plays an important role in collision avoidance, motion planning and aircraft control, among other applications. Previous methods for computing the guaranteed winning initial conditions and strategies for each player have either required augmenting the state vector to include time, or have been limited to problems with either no state constraints or entirely static targets, constraints and dynamics. To incorporate time-varying dynamics, targets and constraints without the need for state augmentation, we propose a modified Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation in the form of a double-obstacle variational inequality, and prove that the zero sublevel set of its viscosity solution characterizes the capture basin for the target under the state constraints. Through this formulation, our method can compute the capture basin and winning strategies for time-varying games at no additional computational cost with respect to the time-invariant case. We provide an implementation of this method based on well-known numerical schemes and show its convergence through a simple example; we include a second example in which our method substantially outperforms the state augmentation approach.},

To make analysis tractable, previous approaches often make various limiting assumptions upon player actions. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing and solving a two-player capture-the-flag game as a zero-sum differential game. Our problem formulation allows each player to make decisions rationally based upon the current player positions, assuming only an upper bound on the movement speeds. Using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis, we compute winning regions for each player as subsets of the joint configuration space and derive the corresponding winning strategies.

The analysis of problems like this is extremely important practically, especially given the growing interest in utilizing unmanned aircraft systems for civil purposes. The direct solution of this problem by solving a single-obstacle Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) variational inequality (VI) is numerically intractable due to the exponential scaling of computation complexity with problem dimensionality. Furthermore, the single-obstacle HJI VI cannot directly handle situations in which vehicles do not have a common scheduled arrival time. Instead, we perform sequential path planning by considering vehicles in order of priority, modeling higher-priority vehicles as time-varying obstacles for lower-priority vehicles. To do this, we solve a double-obstacle HJI VI which allows us to obtain the reach-avoid set, defined as the set of states from which a vehicle can reach its target while staying within a time-varying state constraint set. From the solution of the double-obstacle HJI VI, we can also extract the latest start time and the optimal control for each vehicle. This is a first application of the double-obstacle HJI VI which can handle systems with time-varying dynamics, target sets, and state constraint sets, and results in computation complexity that scales linearly, as opposed to exponentially, with the number of vehicles in consideration.},
