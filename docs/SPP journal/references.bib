abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle systems are currently in limited use for public service missions worldwide. Development of civil unmanned technology in the United States currently lags behind military unmanned technology development in part because of unresolved regulatory and technological issues. Civil unmanned aerial vehicle systems have potential to augment disaster relief and emergency response efforts. Optimal design of aerial systems for such applications will lead to unmanned vehicles which provide maximum potentiality for relief and emergency response while accounting for public safety concerns and regulatory requirements. A case study is presented that demonstrates application of a civil unmanned system to a disaster relief mission with the intent on saving lives. The concept utilizes unmanned aircraft to obtain advanced warning and damage assessments for tornados and severe thunderstorms. Overview of a tornado watch mission architecture as well as commentary on risk, cost, need for, and design tradeoffs for unmanned aerial systems are provided.

@article{Fiorini98,
abstract = {This paper presents a method for robot motion planning in dynamic environments. It consists of selecting avoidance maneuvers to avoid static and moving obstacles in the velocity space, based on the current positions and velocities of the robot and obstacles. It is a first-order method, since it does not integrate velocities to yield positions as functions of time. The avoidance maneuvers are generated by selecting robot velocities outside of the velocity obstacles, which represent the set of robot velocities that would result in a collision with a given obstacle that moves at a given velocity, at some future time. To ensure that the avoidance maneuver is dynamically feasible, the set of avoidance velocities is intersected with the set of admissible velocities, defined by the robot's acceleration constraints. Computing new avoidance maneuvers at regular time intervals accounts for general obstacle trajectories. The trajectory from start to goal is computed by searching a tree of feasible avoidance maneuvers, computed at discrete time intervals. An exhaustive search of the tree yields near-optimal trajectories that either minimize distance or motion time. A heuristic search of the tree is applicable to on-line planning. The method is demonstrated for point and disk robots among static and moving obstacles, and for an automated vehicle in an intelligent vehicle highway system scenario.},

Our approach takes into account the reactive behavior of the other agents by implicitly assuming that the other agents make a similar collision-avoidance reasoning. We show that this method guarantees safe and oscillation- free motions for each of the agents. We apply our concept to navigation of hundreds of agents in densely populated environments containing both static and moving obstacles, and we show that real-time and scalable performance is achieved in such challenging scenarios.},

Three scenarios of multi-vehicle tasking are proposed at the CPP framework. The NTG algorithm is then used to generate a real time trajectory for desired vehicle activities. Given system dynamics and constraints, the NTG algorithm first finds trajectory curves in a lower dimensional space and then parameterizes the curves by the B-spline basis. The coefficients of the B-splines are further solved by the sequential quadratic programming to satisfy the optimization objectives and constraints. The NTG algorithm has been implemented to generate real-time trajectories for a group of cooperative vehicles in the presence of changing missions and constraints.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT We consider minimal time problems governed by nonlinear systems under general time dependent state constraints and in the two-player games setting. In general, it is known that the characterization of the minimal time function, as well as the study of its regularity properties, is a difficult task in particular when no controllability assumption is made. In addition to these difficulties, we are interested here to the case when the target, the state constraints and the dynamics are allowed to be time-dependent. We introduce a particular “reachability” control problem, which has a supremum cost function but is free of state constraints. This auxiliary control problem allows to characterize easily the backward reachable sets, and then, the minimal time function, without assuming any controllability assumption. These techniques are linked to the well known level-set approaches. Partial results of the study have been published recently by the authors in SICON. Here, we generalize the method to more complex problems of moving target and obstacle problems. Our results can be used to deal with motion planning problems with obstacle avoidance.},

@article{Margellos11,
abstract = {A new framework for formulating reachability problems with competing inputs, nonlinear dynamics and state constraints as optimal control problems is developed. Such reach-avoid problems arise in, among others, the study of safety problems in hybrid systems. Earlier approaches to reach-avoid computations are either restricted to linear systems, or face numerical difficulties due to possible discontinuities in the Hamiltonian of the optimal control problem. The main advantage of the approach proposed in this paper is that it can be applied to a general class of target hitting continuous dynamic games with nonlinear dynamics, and has very good properties in terms of its numerical solution, since the value function and the Hamiltonian of the system are both continuous. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to a two aircraft collision avoidance scenario under target window constraints and in the presence of wind disturbance. Target Windows are a novel concept in air traffic management, and represent spatial and temporal constraints, that the aircraft have to respect to meet their schedule.},

The analysis of this problem plays an important role in collision avoidance, motion planning and aircraft control, among other applications. Previous methods for computing the guaranteed winning initial conditions and strategies for each player have either required augmenting the state vector to include time, or have been limited to problems with either no state constraints or entirely static targets, constraints and dynamics. To incorporate time-varying dynamics, targets and constraints without the need for state augmentation, we propose a modified Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation in the form of a double-obstacle variational inequality, and prove that the zero sublevel set of its viscosity solution characterizes the capture basin for the target under the state constraints. Through this formulation, our method can compute the capture basin and winning strategies for time-varying games at no additional computational cost with respect to the time-invariant case. We provide an implementation of this method based on well-known numerical schemes and show its convergence through a simple example; we include a second example in which our method substantially outperforms the state augmentation approach.},

The analysis of problems like this is extremely important practically, especially given the growing interest in utilizing unmanned aircraft systems for civil purposes. The direct solution of this problem by solving a single-obstacle Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) variational inequality (VI) is numerically intractable due to the exponential scaling of computation complexity with problem dimensionality. Furthermore, the single-obstacle HJI VI cannot directly handle situations in which vehicles do not have a common scheduled arrival time. Instead, we perform sequential path planning by considering vehicles in order of priority, modeling higher-priority vehicles as time-varying obstacles for lower-priority vehicles. To do this, we solve a double-obstacle HJI VI which allows us to obtain the reach-avoid set, defined as the set of states from which a vehicle can reach its target while staying within a time-varying state constraint set. From the solution of the double-obstacle HJI VI, we can also extract the latest start time and the optimal control for each vehicle. This is a first application of the double-obstacle HJI VI which can handle systems with time-varying dynamics, target sets, and state constraint sets, and results in computation complexity that scales linearly, as opposed to exponentially, with the number of vehicles in consideration.},

@article{Sethian96,
abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

abstract = {Safety must be ensured in the deployment of multi-agent vehicle systems. This paper presents decentralized collision avoidance algorithms for systems with second order dynamics and acceleration constraints, using a switching control law. The technique augments existing multi-agent control laws with the capability to switch to provably safe collision avoidance maneuvers when required. Two algorithms with low computational cost are presented, one for two vehicles and one for more vehicles. In both methods, each vehicle computes avoid sets with respect to every other vehicle. When one or more vehicles are on the boundary of their avoid sets, collision avoidance action is taken. These algorithms are applied in simulation scenarios for which existing techniques either fail or are computationally expensive, and used for information theoretic control of a mobile sensor network to reduce the computational complexity. Finally, they are demonstrated in quadrotor helicopter flight experiments.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been an immense surge of interest in using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for civil purposes. Multi-UAV systems are safety-critical, and safety guarantees must be made to ensure no undesirable configurations such as collisions occur. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is ideal for analyzing such safety-critical systems because it provides safety guarantees and is flexible in terms of system dynamics; however, its direct application is limited to small-scale systems of no more than two vehicles because of the exponential-scaling computation complexity. By assigning vehicle priorities, the sequential path planning (SPP) method allows multi-vehicle path planning to be done with a computation complexity that scales linearly with the number of vehicles. Previously the SPP method assumed no disturbances in the vehicle dynamics, and that every vehicle has perfect knowledge of the position of higher-priority vehicles. In this paper, we make SPP more practical by providing three different methods for accounting for disturbances in dynamics and imperfect knowledge of higher-priority vehicles. Each method has advantages and disadvantages with different assumptions about information sharing. We demonstrate our proposed methods in simulations.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a novel approach to the n-vehicle collision avoidance problem. The vehicle model used is a planar constant-speed unicycle, chosen for its wide applicability to ground, sea, and air vehicles. An algorithm is developed which guarantees all vehicles remain free of collisions while attempting to attain their trajectory goals (given certain restrictions on their initial conditions). This controller is reactive and decentralized, making it well suited for real time applications, and explicitly accounts for actuation limits. Results are demonstrated in simulation.},

@inproceedings{Chen2016,
abstract = {Multi-agent differential games are important and useful tools for analyzing many practical problems, such as air traffic management and multi-vehicle collision avoidance. With the recent surge of interest in using UAVs for civil purposes, the importance and urgency of developing tractable multi-agent analysis techniques that provide safety and performance guarantees is at an all-time high. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability has successfully provided safety guarantees to small-scale systems and is flexible in terms of system dynamics. However, the exponential complexity scaling of HJ reachability prevents its direct application to large scale problems when the number of vehicles is greater than two. In this paper, we overcome the scalability limitations of HJ reachability by using a mixed integer program that exploits the properties of HJ solutions to provide higher-level control logic. Our proposed method provides safety guarantee for three-vehicle systems -- a previously intractable task for HJ reachability -- without incurring significant additional computation cost. Furthermore, our method is scalable beyond three vehicles and performs significantly better by several metrics than an extension of pairwise collision avoidance to multi-vehicle collision avoidance. We demonstrate our proposed method in simulations.},

@article{Wu2012,
abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to guaranteeing collision avoidance with respect to moving obstacles that have constrained dynamics but move unpredictably. Velocity Obstacles have been used previously to plan trajectories that avoid collisions with obstacles under the assumption that the trajectories of the objects are either known or can be accurately predicted ahead of time. However, for real systems this predicted trajectory will typically only be accurate over short time-horizons. To achieve safety over longer time periods, this paper instead considers the set of all reachable points by an obstacle assuming that the dynamics fit the unicycle model, which has known constant forward speed and a maximum turn rate (sometimes called the Dubins car model). This paper extends the Velocity Obstacle formulation by using reachability sets in place of a single ” known” trajectory to find matching constraints in velocity space, called Velocity Obstacle Sets. The Velocity Obstacle Set for each obstacle is equivalent to the union of all velocity obstacles corresponding to any dynamically feasible future trajectory, given the obstacle's current state. This region remains bounded as the time horizon is increased to infinity, and by choosing control inputs that lie outside of these Velocity Obstacle Sets, it is guaranteed that the host agent can always actively avoid collisions with the obstacles, even without knowing their exact future trajectories. Furthermore it is proven that, subject to certain initial conditions, an iterative planner under these constraints guarantees safety for all time. Such an iterative planner is implemented and demonstrated in simulation.},

Reachable sets are used to represent the collection of possible trajectories of obstacle aircraft. It is used in collision prediction for UAVs in path planning. Once a collision is detected, a sampling-based method is used to generate a collision avoidance path. A second collision check is performed on the generated path with the updated UAV and aircraft' states. The path is re-planned if it leads to another collision. The algorithm is validated in Software-In-the-Loop simulation. ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast) data logged from commercial aircraft are used as the obstacle aircraft. The experiments show that reachable set improves the success rate for collision avoidance compared to the linear motion assumption for the obstacle aircraft.},

A reachable set is the set of states a system can reach for a given set of initial states, disturbances, and sensor noise values. We consider autonomous vehicles which plan trajectories for a certain look-ahead horizon which are followed using feedback control. While a perfectly followed trajectory might not violate specified safety properties (e.g. lane departures or vehicle collisions), a violating deviation from the planned trajectory might exist. Given the mathematical model of the controlled vehicle and bounds on uncertainty, our approach detects any possible violation. In addition, the approach provides results faster than the time required to finish the planned maneuvers of the autonomous vehicle.},

The proposed avoidance control laws are easy to design and implement, and may be directly appended to the optimal control laws of the individual agents within the cooperation framework. The avoidance control laws are computed using value functions that resemble the behavior of barrier functions in the static optimization theory. The most attractive feature of the proposed optimization scheme is the fact that the avoidance laws are active only in the bounded sensing regions of each individual agent, and they do not interfere with the agents' individual optimal control laws outside of these regions},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework for provably safe decentralized trajectory planning of multiple (autonomous) aircraft. Each aircraft plans its trajectory individually using a receding horizon strategy based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). A con- strained, inertial, first-order linear model is used to capture the dynamics and kinematics of the vehicle. Safety is guaranteed by maintaining, at each time step, a dynamically feasible trajectory for each aircraft that terminates in a loiter pattern. Conflicts between multiple aircraft are resolved in a sequential, decentralized fashion, in which each aircraft takes into account the latest trajectory and loiter pattern of the other aircraft. Besides maintaining feasibility, if the problem is too complex to be solved within the time constraints of a real- time system, this approach also provides an a priori safe rescue solution consisting of the previous trajectories and individual loiter patterns. Several examples of conflict situations resolved by the proposed method are presented.},
