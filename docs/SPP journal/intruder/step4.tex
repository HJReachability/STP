\subsection{Step 4}
Under Assumption \ref{as:avoidOnce}, a vehicle $\veh{i}$ does not need to avoid an intruder more than once. Thus, after performing an avoidance maneuver, $\veh{i}$ can simply resume moving towards its destination given by $\targetset_i$ while avoiding the (un-augmented) obstacles $\obsset_i(t)$ in \eqref{}. The optimal controller for this task is obtained from the backwards reachable set $\brs(t, \targetset_i, \obsset_i, H_\text{liveness}$) where $H_\text{liveness}(t, x, p)$ is given in Section \ref{sec:basic}.
