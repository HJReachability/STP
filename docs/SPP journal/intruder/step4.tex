\subsection{Step 4}
Under the assumption that a vehicle $\veh{i}$ does not need to avoid an intruder more than once, after performing an avoidance maneuver, $\veh{i}$ can simply resume moving towards its destination given by $\targetset_i$. The optimal controller for this task is obtained from the backwards reachable set $\brs(t, \targetset_i, \obsset_i, H_\text{liveness}$) where $H_\text{liveness}(t, x, p)$ is given in Section \ref{sec:basic}.

Since $\veh{i}$ no longer needs to take into account the possible presence of intruders, obstacle augmentation is not needed. To guarantee safety, $\veh{i}$ can simply avoid the induced obstacles $\ioset_i^j(t), j < i$, and the static obstacles $\soset$.
