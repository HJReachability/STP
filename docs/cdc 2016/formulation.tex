\section{Problem Formulation \label{sec:formulation}}
Consider $N$ vehicles whose joint dynamics described by

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x}_i = f_i(t, x_i, u_i, d_i) \\
|u_i| \in \cset \\
|d_i| \in \dset \\
i = 1,\ldots, N
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where blah blah and [STANDARD ASSUMPTIONS HERE].

Under the worst case disturbance, each vehicle aims to get to some target state, denoted $\targeti{i}$ at some scheduled time of arrival $\sta$. On its way to the target state, each vehicle $i$ must avoid the danger zones $\aseti{i}(t)$ of all other vehicles $j\neq i$ for all time, defined as

\begin{equation}
\aseti{i}(t) = \bigcup_j \{x_i: \|x_i - x_j(t)\| \le \cradius \}
\end{equation}
